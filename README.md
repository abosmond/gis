# gis
GIS application for freightage distribution. Created using OpenLayers 2.x, PHP, and MySQL. 
You can add the marker dynamically from the application, you can add point, line, and polygon into the maps 
and it will be saved into database. For maps, I use openstreetmaps.

For the demo, you can check it out at http://gis.abosmond.com.
